## System Overview

Monolithic Next.js 15 app using the App Router. PostgreSQL via Prisma for persistence. NextAuth for authentication. Deployed on Vercel with preview deploys on every PR.

The app has three main surfaces:
- **Public marketing pages** — static, ISR-rebuilt nightly
- **Authenticated dashboard** — dynamic, server-rendered per-request
- **API layer** — Next.js route handlers under `src/app/api/`

## Data Flow

```
Browser → Next.js App Router → Route Handler → Prisma Client → PostgreSQL
                                    ↓
                              Zod validation at entry
                              Result<T,E> return types
                              No raw SQL — Prisma queries only
```

Server components fetch data directly via Prisma helpers in `src/lib/db/`. Client components call API routes through `src/lib/api-client.ts`, which wraps fetch with auth headers and error normalization.

## Key Decisions

- **Server components by default.** Client components only for interactivity (forms, modals, real-time). Every `'use client'` should have a clear reason.
- **Zustand over Redux.** One store per domain concept (`src/stores/`). No global god-store. Server state stays server-side; Zustand is for UI state only.
- **Result types over exceptions.** Functions that can fail return `{ok: true, data}` or `{ok: false, error}`. See `src/lib/errors.ts`. This makes error paths explicit at call sites.
- **Colocation.** Tests live next to source files (`__tests__/` subdirectories). Page-specific components live in their route directory, not in the shared `components/` folder.

## Boundaries

- **`src/generated/`** — Auto-generated by Prisma. Never hand-edit. Run `prisma generate` after schema changes.
- **`src/config.ts`** — Single source for all env vars. Validated at startup with Zod. Components and lib code import from here, never from `process.env`.
- **`src/lib/db/`** — Only place Prisma client is used. Route handlers and server components call functions from here, not Prisma directly. This keeps the query surface auditable.

## External Dependencies

- **Stripe** — Payment processing. Webhook handler at `src/app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts`. Test with `stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/webhooks/stripe`.
- **Cloudinary** — Image uploads and transforms. Helper at `src/lib/cloudinary.ts`. Dev uses the sandbox account (keys in `.env.local`).
- **Resend** — Transactional email. Templates in `src/lib/email/templates/`. Dev sends to Ethereal (fake SMTP).
