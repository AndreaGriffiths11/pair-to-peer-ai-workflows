# From Pair to Peer: AI Workflows That Actually Work

![Merging Human + AI Animation](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/81ae08ae-71d2-47c1-898d-d99b22d44846)

## The Thesis
- Teams win with **Standards, Experience, and Fluency**—and the industry now agrees. GitHub’s [“From pair to peer programmer” vision](https://github.blog/news-insights/product-news/from-pair-to-peer-programmer-our-vision-for-agentic-workflows-in-github-copilot/) validates the shift from copilots to peer agents.
- The data backs it: Octoverse 2025 shows **1.13M repos importing LLM SDKs (+178% YoY)**; Universe 2025 launched **Agent HQ, Mission Control, and Custom Copilot Agents**; Copilot Spaces and the MCP Registry made context-native agents mainstream.
- New reality: GPT-5.2 GA, Claude Opus 4.5 GA, Gemini 3 Flash preview. Agentic AI is here—teams need governance, trust, and fluency, not just speed.

## The Three Patterns That Work
- **Standards Before Speed** — Governance-first: code review tiers for agent-authored PRs, MCP server security, blast-radius checks, and autonomy limits.
- **Experience Over Output** — Track developer trust, delegation comfort, and agent handoff quality (Copilot agent mode, background jobs) before obsessing over velocity.
- **Fluency Over Dependency** — Build skills in agent orchestration, MCP literacy, and reviewing agent-generated changes so the team improves faster than the tools.

## Interactive Tools
- **AI-First Decision Tree** (`docs/index.html`) — now includes **AGENT-DELEGATED** guidance, autonomy risk, and MCP integration signals.
- **Team Assessment** (`docs/team-assessment.html`) — standards, experience, fluency, plus **agent governance, permissions, delegation trust, Spaces adoption, orchestration, and MCP literacy**.
- **Developer Experience Health Check** (`docs/developer-experience.html`) — adds agent-mode vs. edit-mode guidance, agent PR review confidence, MCP awareness, and autonomy boundaries.
- **Teaching Moments** (`docs/teaching-moments.html`) — capture learnings including **agent mode vs. edit mode, delegation wins/misses, MCP setup, and multi-agent orchestration**.
- **Resources Hub** (`docs/resources.html`) — curated ecosystem, articles, talks, newsletter issues, and related tools.

## The Ecosystem
- **[Agent Context System](https://agent-context-system-acolombiadev.zocomputer.io/)** — agent workspace with persistent context
- **[teamxray](https://github.com/AndreaGriffiths11/teamxray)** — VS Code extension for expertise analysis via git history + GitHub Models + MCP
- **[open-source-best-practices](https://github.com/AndreaGriffiths11/open-source-best-practices)** — 8-phase OSS skill framework with agentic AI
- **[mcp-config-scan](https://github.com/AndreaGriffiths11/mcp-config-scan)** — Go-based MCP config security scanner
- **[mcp-tips](https://github.com/AndreaGriffiths11/mcp-tips)** — MCP server best practices
- **[git-history-cleaner](https://github.com/AndreaGriffiths11/git-history-cleaner)** — safe git history cleanup

## Research & Data
- Deloitte: 25% of companies running agentic pilots in 2025, 50% by 2027; integration and risk management cited as the hardest problems.
- McKinsey: clear governance → **+37% adoption success**, **-41% security problems**.
- Microsoft: productivity gains take ~11 weeks, not days—plan onboarding accordingly.
- GitHub Enterprise Research: structured knowledge sharing drives **~40% better outcomes** vs. individual AI experts.
- GitHub Octoverse 2025: **1.13M public repos** importing LLM SDKs (+178% YoY).
- GitHub Universe 2025: Agent HQ, Mission Control, Custom Copilot Agents announced.

## What to Expect (Timeline)
- Weeks 1-2: pushback on governance—stick to standards-first to avoid AI-induced debt.
- Month 1: team reviews and questions agent output instead of treating it as magic.
- Month 3: AI wins are shared without prompting; knowledge compounds.
- Month 6: human creativity + AI efficiency becomes the team’s differentiator.

## Start Today
- Run the **AI-First Decision Tree** for your next feature to choose AI-first, AI-assisted, human-first, or **agent-delegated**.
- Take the **Team Assessment** to find your weakest pattern; pull one practice into this sprint.
- Capture one **Teaching Moment** this week (agent mode vs. edit mode, delegation wins/misses).
- Use the **DX Health Check** monthly; trigger AI analysis via the built-in GitHub Action.
