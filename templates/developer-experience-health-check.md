## Scoring and Analysis Framework

**Category Scores (Average of questions):**
- AI Integration: Questions 1-5
- Skill Balance: Questions 6-10  
- Learning Velocity: Questions 11-15
- Quality Confidence: Questions 16-20
- Team Process: Questions 21-25

**Health Indicators:**
- **Healthy Range:** 3.5-4.5 average per category
- **At Risk:** 2.5-3.4 average (needs attention)
- **Critical:** Below 2.5 average (immediate action required)

**Red Flag Indicators:**
- AI Integration high (>4.0) but Skill Balance low (<3.0) = Over-dependence risk
- Quality Confidence below 3.0 = Security/quality risk
- Learning Velocity declining over multiple months = Skill development stagnation
