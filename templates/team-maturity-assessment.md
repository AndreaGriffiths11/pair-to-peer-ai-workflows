## Scoring & Interpretation

### Calculate Your Scores
```
Standards-First Score = (Governance×10% + Code Review×15% + Security×15%) × 40%
Experience Metrics Score = (Dev Satisfaction×10% + Productivity×15% + Learning×10%) × 35%  
AI Fluency Score = (Training×10% + Knowledge Mgmt×8% + Innovation×7%) × 25%

Total Maturity Score = Standards-First + Experience Metrics + AI Fluency
```
